        In my free time, I enjoy working on side projects, learning new
        technologies, flying airplanes (sometimes upside-down), scuba diving
        into caves, making music, playing with microcontrollers, building
        elaborate animated halloween props and contributing to open-source
        software. I&apos;m passionate about creating and building new things,
        and I love to share my knowledge and experience with others. I&apos;m
        always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I&apos;m
        excited to see what the future holds.
