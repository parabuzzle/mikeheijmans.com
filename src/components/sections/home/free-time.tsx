        In my free time, I enjoy working on open source projects, learning new
        technologies, flying airplanes (sometimes upside-down), scuba diving
        into caves, making music, playing with microcontrollers, and building
        elaborate animated halloween props. I&apos;m passionate about creating
        and building new things, and I love to share my knowledge and experience
        with others. I&apos;m always looking for new opportunities to learn and
        grow, and I&apos;m excited to see what the future holds.
