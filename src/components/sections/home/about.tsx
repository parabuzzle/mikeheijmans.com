        I&apos;m a senior software leader, engineer, and developer, with two
        decades of experience, a keen eye for detail, and the ability to see the
        bigger picture. I learn and apply new skills quickly, and am committed
        to building high-performing teams and efficient, reliable systems.
        Throughout my career, I&apos;ve led globally distributed teams and
        managed projects, from automating CI/CD pipelines to implementing
        Kubernetes-based solutions, always focused on improving speed, quality,
        and the user experience.
