Welcome to Engineering Hell! A community driven collection of stories from engineers who have experienced hell in their careers. These stories are meant to be shared with the community to help others avoid the same fate. The goal of Engineering Hell is to provide a platform for engineers to share their stories and learn from each other. We believe that by sharing our experiences, we can help each other grow and become better engineers.

Engineering Hell has a goal of being a community driven collection of stories from engineers who have experienced hell in their careers. These stories are meant to be shared with the community to help others avoid the same fate. We believe that by sharing our experiences, we can help each other grow and become better engineers.

This is why I decided to start Engineering Hell. I have been an engineer for nearly 20 years and have seen my fair share of hell in my career. I want to help others avoid the same fate and learn from my experiences. I believe that by sharing our stories, we can help each other grow and become better engineers. In the past couple years alone, I have faced a ton of challenges in the hardware and embedded world that I wanted to document and share with others. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that there are so many engineers out there with their own stories to tell. I wanted to create a platform where we could all come together and share our experiences. So I hope you join me in this experiment and share your own stories with the community here.

The site is built using Docusaurus, a modern static site generator, and is meant to be a community project. We use markdown files to create our stories and blog posts. You can find more information about Docusaurus [here](https://docusaurus.io/).
